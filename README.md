# Convert numerical grades into letter grades
Goals: I wanted to get more experience with Python, so I created a simple program that converts decimal grades into letter grades

The program has the option to either read from user input or read from csv files. If you choose to read a csv file, it will write the updated letter grades back to the same csv file

The format of the csv file is as follows (not comma-delimited supported at the moment, only space-delimited):

Names Grades

Jorge 86.3
